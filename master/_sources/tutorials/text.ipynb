This dataset contains 50,000 text reviews, each labeled with a binary sentiment polarity label indicating whether the review is positive (1) or negative (0). cleanlab will shortlist _hundreds_ of examples that confuse our ML model the most; many of which are potential label errors, edge cases, or otherwise ambiguous examples.\n",

    "We can see that the test set accuracy slightly improved as a result of the data cleaning. Note that this will not always be the case, especially when we are evaluating on test data that are themselves noisy. The best practice is to run cleanlab to identify potential label issues and then manually review them, before blindly trusting any accuracy metrics. In particular, the most effort should be made to ensure high-quality test data, which is supposed to reflect the expected performance of our model during deployment.\n"
